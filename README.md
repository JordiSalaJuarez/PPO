# PPO
[![Open PPO in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JordiSalaJuarez/PPO/blob/main/getting_started_ppo.ipynb)<br>

Main scripts and Python files are encountered in the main PPO folder.
The main coe would be the script called ppo.py.
The folder named "results" contains the .csv's from most of the simulations.
The folder named "jobs" contains the .sh's scripts which get other .sh's scripts (the jobs) to send them to run on the cluster and some results, the most updated ones.
